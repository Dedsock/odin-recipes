    <h2>Da Plot:</h2>
    <p>"Behold the ultimate Italian blasphemy—a pizza shaped like a pineapple and topped with it, because why settle for one abomination when you can double down? This doughy disaster takes a perfectly good crust, molds it into a spiky fruit silhouette, then piles on chunks of pineapple like it’s mocking Nonna’s entire lineage. The cheese melts in shame, the sauce weeps marinara tears, and every bite screams 'Mamma ohh!!!' in horrified betrayal. Serve it hot to your Italian friends if you want to see a grown man cry—or a rolling pin aimed at your head."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients to steal from your papi who went to buy milk:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 batch pizza dough: Kneaded with the tears of a Sicilian baker who just saw your plans.</li>
            <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese: Shredded in despair, melting into a gooey surrender over this travesty.</li>
            <li>1 whole pineapple: Hollowed out to shape the crust, then chopped up and scattered on top like a tropical middle finger to Italy.</li>
            <li>1 loud 'Mamma ohh!!!': Screamed while shaping the dough into a pineapple, because even the oven knows this is cursed.</li>
            <li>½ cup marinara sauce: Straight from a jar, because authenticity left the building the moment pineapple entered the chat.</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil: Drizzled on as a weak apology to the pizza gods who are definitely judging you.</li>
            <li>1 pinch of Hawaiian audacity: Because it takes real guts to pull this off and call it pizza.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>How to birth this abomination:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shape the dough into a pineapple silhouette</li>
            <li>Slather with sauce</li>
            <li>Bury it in cheese and pineapple chunks</li>
            <li>Yell 'Mamma ohh!!!' as you slide it into the oven</li>
            <li>Bake until the crust is golden and the Italians in your life disown you</li>
        </ol>
